# Get-to-know-me


Hello!
My name is Abby. I am currently a Junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. Go Cyclones!
I am very excited to learn more about coding and how to create my own programs more efficently!
When I'm not doing Aerospace related things I love to read and embroider! Two books that I recently have loved are As Long As The Lemon Trees Grows by Zoulfa Katouh and Daisy Darker by Alice Feeney. Go read them!
